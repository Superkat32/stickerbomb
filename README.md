# Stickerbomb!
The minecraft mod that adds stickers!

## Adding stickers
By default, stickerbomb comes with a few stickers, but you can also add your own via resource packs (including the one bunbled in your mod)

Just place the texture files for your stickers at `assets/{namespace}/textures/sticker`, and stickerbomb will automatically load them up when resource packs load or reload.
